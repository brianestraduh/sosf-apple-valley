# About SOSF

## Our Story

Submissions of Success Foundation (SOSF) was founded with a simple but powerful vision: to provide at-risk youth with access to combat sports training and mentorship that can transform their lives.

## Mission Statement

We believe that every young person deserves a coach in their cornerâ€”someone who believes in them and helps them develop the discipline, confidence, and resilience needed to succeed in life.

## What We Do

### Training Access
We partner with local gyms to provide subsidized or free training in boxing, wrestling, BJJ, and MMA to youth who might not otherwise have access.

### Mentorship
Our volunteer mentors work one-on-one with participants, providing guidance both inside and outside the gym.

### Community Building
We create a supportive community where youth can develop lasting friendships and positive role models.

## Our Values

- **Discipline**: We teach self-control and commitment
- **Respect**: We foster respect for oneself and others
- **Perseverance**: We encourage pushing through challenges
- **Community**: We build strong, supportive networks

## Impact

Since our founding, SOSF has served over 500 youth, partnered with 50+ gyms, and recruited 100+ volunteer mentors. Our participants show an 85% improvement in school attendance and behavior.
