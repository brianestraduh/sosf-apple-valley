            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Submissions of Success Foundation (SOSF) was founded with a simple but powerful
              vision: to provide at-risk youth with access to combat sports training and mentorship
              that can transform their lives.
            </p>
            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that every young person deserves a coach in their cornerâ€”someone who
              believes in them and helps them develop the discipline, confidence, and resilience
              needed to succeed in life.
            </p>
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <h3>Training Access</h3>
            <p>
              We partner with local gyms to provide subsidized or free training in boxing,
              wrestling, BJJ, and MMA to youth who might not otherwise have access.
            </p>
            <h3>Mentorship</h3>
            <p>
              Our volunteer mentors work one-on-one with participants, providing guidance both
              inside and outside the gym.
            </p>
            <h3>Community Building</h3>
            <p>
              We create a supportive community where youth can develop lasting friendships and
              positive role models.
